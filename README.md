# MiniProject
Its my second year acadamic simple project. "Obstacle Avoider Bot" - The function of the bot is to move away from the obstacle infront or besides of it.

Component:
  12V DC Motor,
  IR Sensor modules,
  IC 7404,
  IC 7805,
  IC L293D,
  Breadboard,
  Bot chasis,
  
The obstacle sensors are used to avoid the robot from obstacles in the path. For obstacle sensing we are using IR-sensors which will have transmitter and receiver parts. 
Infrared Rays are sent by transmitter and if there is a obstacle the rays get hit and reflected and will be received by transmitter. These sensors are connected to a motor driven IC which controls the motion of wheels.
In the front there are two sensors in left and right corners.
While the left corner sensor sense the obstacle, It insists the left wheel to move. Likewise If the right corner sensor sense the obstacle, It insists the right wheel to move. 
If the two sensors sense the obstacles, It stopsâ€¦.
